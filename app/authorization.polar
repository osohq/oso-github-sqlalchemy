# ALLOW RULES

### Users can see other users in their organization
allow(user: User, _action, resource: User) if
    org in user.organizations and org in resource.organizations;

# RBAC RULES

# USER-ROLE RELATIONSHIPS

### Users inherit repository roles from their teams
user_in_role(user: User, role, repo: Repository) if
	team in user.teams and
	role in team.repository_roles and
	role.repository.id = repo.id;

# RESOURCE-ROLE RELATIONSHIPS

## These rules allow roles to apply to resources other than those that they are scoped to.
## The most common example of this is nested resources, e.g. Repository roles should apply to the Issues
## nested in that repository.


### An organization's roles apply to its child repositories
resource_role_applies_to(repo: Repository, parent_org) if
    parent_org := repo.organization and
    parent_org matches Organization;

### An organization's roles apply to its child teams
resource_role_applies_to(team: Team, parent_org) if
    parent_org := team.organization and
    parent_org matches Organization;

### An organization's roles apply to its child roles
resource_role_applies_to(role: OrganizationRole, parent_org) if
    parent_org := role.organization and
    parent_org matches Organization;

### A repository's roles apply to its child roles
resource_role_applies_to(role: RepositoryRole, parent_repo) if
    parent_repo = role.repository and
    parent_repo matches Repository;

### An organization's roles apply to its child repository's roles
resource_role_applies_to(role: RepositoryRole, parent_org) if
    parent_org := role.repository.organization and
    parent_org matches Organization;

### A repository's roles apply to its child issues
resource_role_applies_to(issue: Issue, parent_repo) if
    parent_repo := issue.repository;

# ROLE-PERMISSION RELATIONSHIPS

## Record-level Organization Permissions

### All organization roles let users read organizations
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole, "READ", _org: Organization);

role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "BILLING"}, "READ_BILLING", _org: Organization);
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "LIST_ROLES", _org: Organization);
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "LIST_REPOS", _org: Organization);
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "LIST_TEAMS", _org: Organization);

## OrganizationRole Permissions

### Organization owners can access the Organization's roles
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "READ", _role_resource: OrganizationRole);

## Repository Permissions

### Read role can read the repository
role_allow(_role: RepositoryRole{name: "READ"}, "READ", _repo: Repository);

### Read role can read the repository
role_allow(_role: RepositoryRole{name: "WRITE"}, "WRITE", _repo: Repository);

### All organization members can create repositories
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "CREATE", _repo: Repository);

### Organization "Read" base roles
role_allow(role: OrganizationRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "READ", repo: Repository) if
    role.organization.id = repo.organization.id and
    repo.organization.base_repo_role = "READ";

### RepositoryRoles with read access can also read the repository's issues
role_allow(role: RepositoryRole, "READ", issue: Issue) if
    repo := issue.repository and
    repo matches Repository and
    role_allow(role, "READ", repo);

role_allow(_role: RepositoryRole{name: "READ"}, "LIST_ISSUES", _repo: Repository);
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "LIST_ROLES", _repo: Repository);
role_allow(_role: RepositoryRole{name: "ADMIN"}, "LIST_ROLES", _repo: Repository);


## RepositoryRole Permissions

role_allow(_role: RepositoryRole{name: "ADMIN"}, "READ", _role_resource: RepositoryRole);
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "READ", _role_resource: RepositoryRole);

## Team Permissions

### Organization owners can view all teams in the org
role_allow(_role: OrganizationRole{name: "OWNER"}, "READ", _team: Team);

### Team members are able to see their own teams
role_allow(_role: TeamRole{name: "MEMBER"}, "READ", _team: Team);

# ROLE-ROLE RELATIONSHIPS

## Role Hierarchies

### Specify repository role order (most senior on left)
repository_role_order(["ADMIN", "MAINTAIN", "WRITE", "TRIAGE", "READ"]);

### Specify organization role order (most senior on left)
organization_role_order(["OWNER", "MEMBER"]);
organization_role_order(["OWNER", "BILLING"]);

### Specify team role order (most senior on left)
team_role_order(["MAINTAINER", "MEMBER"]);
